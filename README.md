# 💳 Credit Card Transaction Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a large credit card transaction dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to uncover insights, detect patterns, and prepare the data for further modeling or visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `eda.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook for EDA  
- `.gitignore` — Ensures large files like datasets are excluded from Git  
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions  
- `data.csv` — **Not included in the repo** due to file size limits (see below)

---

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset is too large to include directly in this repository (**338MB**), so it's hosted externally.
